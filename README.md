# **`Computer-Graphics---CSE410`**
A compilation of all the Computer Graphics Assignment I did in my undergrad

# `Offline1`
The project implements the following :
- A fully controllable camera : camera moves according to the instruction specified in https://github.com/Mashiatmm/Computer-Graphics---CSE410/blob/master/Offline1/Read%20Me.pdf
- Sphere to/ From cube : implementation of this with the controllable camera can be found in the `first_2.exe`
- Wheel : implementation of this can be found in the `third.exe`

# `Offline2`
Implementation of Raster based graphics pipeline.
- `Stage 1:` modeling transformation
- `Stage 2:` view transformation
- `Stage 3:` projection transformation
- `Stage 4:` clipping & scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm

A demo of the input can be found in `input_output` folder.

The output is given below <br/>
